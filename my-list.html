                    Green tea is another type of tea made from the camellia sinensis plant. Green teas often brew up a
                    light green or yellow color, and tend to have a lighter body and milder taste. They contain about
                    half as much caffeine as black tea (about a quarter that of a cup of coffee.) Popular green teas
                    include Gunpowder, Jasmine Yin Cloud, and Moroccan Mint.

                    Oolong tea (also known as wulong tea) is allowed to undergo partial oxidation. These teas have a
                    caffeine content between that of green teas and black teas. The flavor of oolong (wulong) teas is
                    typically not as robust as blacks or as subtle as greens, but has its own extremely fragrant and
                    intriguing tones. Oolongs (wulongs) are often compared to the taste and aroma of fresh flowers or
                    fresh fruit.

                    Black tea is allowed to wither, which precedes a process called oxidation (sometimes incorrectly
                    referred to as fermentation) during which water evaporates out of the leaf and the leaf absorbs more
                    oxygen from the air. Black teas usually undergo full oxidation, and the results are the
                    characteristic dark brown and black leaf, the typically more robust and pronounced flavors of black
                    teas, and when brewed appropriately, a higher caffeine content compared to other teas (50-65% of
                    coffee, depending on the type and brewing technique).

                    White tea is a delicate, minimally processed tea that is highly sought after by connoisseurs and
                    enjoyed by experts and novices alike. White tea has a light body and a mild flavor with a crisp,
                    clean finish. White tea tends to be very low in caffeine, although some silver tip teas may be
                    slightly higher in caffeine. Popular white teas include Bashan Silver Tip and White Peony.

                    Purple tea is a relatively new kind of tea, and has only been commercially available for a few
                    years. The tea is produced from a rare purple-leaved tea plant found growing wild in the Assam
                    region of India. Today, purple teas are primarily produced in Kenya, Africa. They have a light body
                    and mellow flavor, and are extremely low in caffeine and high in antioxidants and anthocyanins.

                <p class="item-text"> <strong>Benefits:</strong>Purple tea is helpful in improving and maintaining
                    cardiovascular health by helping to relax and dilate blood vessels. 
                    Purple tea also helps by reducing cholesterol levels, which is
                    crucial for boosting heart health. </p>
